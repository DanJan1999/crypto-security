In December 2020, we saw a breach in security into some US government agencies and other larger businesses. 
This was able to occur due to them all using the same network management software. 
When the hackers realized this, they were able to insert malware that gathered information and 
slowly etched deeper into the users information.
As early as March 2020, this malware started spreading and letting the hackers in to more and 
more information, including Office 365 for some government officials.
The motive seems to be mostly observation but there was still damage done.
